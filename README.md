## Task 1: Get Websites Links JSON File from API

The first task involves getting a websites links JSON file from a given API. To accomplish this, the project utilizes JavaScript to make a GET request to the API endpoint, and upon successful retrieval of the JSON file, the website links are displayed on the page.

## Task 2: Unfair Dice

The second task involves creating an unfair dice that looks unsuspicious but only gets results of 2 or 6. The project achieves this by using JavaScript to generate random numbers between 1 and 6, but with a higher probability of returning 2 or 6. This unfair dice is represented visually on the webpage, and clicking the dice results in a roll with a 2 or 6 outcome.
